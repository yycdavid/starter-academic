I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at MIT, advised by [Martin Rinard](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/).
My research interest lies in the intersection between programming languages and machine learning.
My recent work focuses on developing neurosymbolic techniques that combine neural and probabilistic methods with program synthesis.

Prior to joining MIT, I finished my B.A. and M.Eng. in Information Engineering at University of Cambridge.
In summer 2020, I interned at Google Brain on systems for ML.
